# AES

This project of M1 cryptography consist in implementing the algorithm AES in C with at least the mode ECB to encrypt and decrypt file of any size with key of legnth 128 bits.
For now, only the ECB mode is implemented but the program can encrypt and decrypt file of any size with a key of size 128,192 or 256 bits.

## Build 

To build this project just download it and run `make`.

```shell
$ make # Compile
$ make clean # Remove intermediate file of compilation
$ make help # Print help of every make command possible
```
